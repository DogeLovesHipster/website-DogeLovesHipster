### This is a work in progress currently! Thanks for your patience!

I did actually decide to go ahead and make this public to demostrate the libraries and approach I took to make this website. This repo has an automatic deployement system that allows my github pushes to update my website that is being honest on Google Cloud. No need to complicate things!

## Introduction

This portfolio website is designed to be responsive, interactive, and visually appealing, utilizing a range of technologies including React, Three.js, and Tailwind CSS. It's a perfect blend of my technical prowess and creative flair.

## Features

- **Interactive 3D Elements**: Utilizing `@react-three/fiber` and `@react-three/drei` for engaging 3D experiences.
- **Animation and Motion**: Leveraging `framer-motion` for smooth and dynamic user interfaces.
