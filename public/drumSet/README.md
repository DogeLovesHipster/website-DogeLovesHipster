JS event handlers+functions+loops
[X] Add event listeners to each button (did this in class)

[X] Add a drum sound to the event listener loop (start with one sound) (one way is the HTMLAudioElement)

[X] In the css, assign a background image to each of the buttons

[X] Assign the associated sound with the image to each button, creating a keyboard

## -part 2-

[X] Add functionality so that the keyboard can also be pressed to activate the sounds.

[X] One way to do it: add event listener to the entire document, a `keydown`

[X] Use console.log to see what happens when you are building this (especially if you are using line by line copilot)

[X] If you are using ChatGPT, you will need to comment out code and test everything to understand how everything is working, also add console.logs
